``Level 6``

Welcome to the "tree" branch. 
Looks like good ol' Linus modified the "nextclue_input.cpp" file. 
Normally, when ran with the shell script "outputclue.sh", the "nextclue_input.cpp" file would give us the next hint.

Maybe, you should try running the shell script with the "nextclue_input.cpp" file and see what happens...

You can run the script by running the command "./outputclue.sh FILE" .
If you are on Windows, it's okey to use `git-bash` that is installed with [msysgit](https://msysgit.github.io/).
