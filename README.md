Welcome to the git-game!! 

This is a terminal game designed to test
your knowledge of git commands.

NOTE: Any executables in this game were
compiled in linux. Thus, are unlikely to
work on other platforms.

NOTE: All branches and tags are lowercase, unless
otherwise stated.

DISCLAIMER: If you change certain files or
branches without following the game, it is
possible that the game will no longer become
playable! If this happens you can always
reclone the project.

Let's get this journey started!! If you haven't
already, then you should clone this repository,
by running:

`git clone https://github.com/hgarc014/git-game.git`

You can start by traversing previous commits
to find your first clue. Check the logs and
traverse to the commit whose message is the
answer to this question: When a programmer is
born, what is the first thing he/she learns
to say?
