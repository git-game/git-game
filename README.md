``Level 10``

Welcome!! It looks like you made it to my Branch!!!
Generally you want to refrain from making tags the same name as branches, unless you have a good reason.
The tag is more like the stable release.
While the branch is more like the in progress feature, which will be added soon.

You're almost done!! Excited?? Hope you are! You have one more thing to do!

Now its time to update the master branch, updating is really useful when you fork a repository and your forked repo starts to get behind on commits. The repository to update from is: https://github.com/drami025/git-game.git

Don't cheat!!

Here is a [link](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) that explains how to fork a remote repository.

Git Game Finish Line
==========

If you did not update the main git-game repository, then we are disappointed in you!!
=======

However, if you did, then great Job!!
You completed our Git Game!


Well you:

- viewed previous commits using "git log"
- traversed to previous commits
- checked out to different branches
- ran "git blame" to see who made changes to a file
- ran the diff command to see differences between branches
- saw what .gitignore included and how it works
- resolved merged conflicts
- saw issues with naming tags and branches the same name
- updated a local repository from a remote repository
 
 Version control systems like git are extremely important tools to learn and use, 
 Especially when collaborating on projects with other developers. 
 It is our hope that you continue to practice your git skills so that you can one day become the ultimate git master!

 Thanks for playing!
