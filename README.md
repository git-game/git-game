``Level 10``

Welcome!! It looks like you made it to my Branch!!!
Generally you want to refrain from making tags the same name as branches, unless you have a good reason.
The tag is more like the stable release.
While the branch is more like the in progress feature, which will be added soon.

You're almost done!! Excited?? Hope you are! You have one more thing to do!

Now its time to update the master branch, updating is really useful when you fork a repository and your forked repo starts to get behind on commits. The repository to update from is: https://github.com/drami025/git-game.git

Don't cheat!!

Here is a [link](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) that explains how to fork a remote repository.
